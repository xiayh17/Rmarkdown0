  abstract = {Breast cancer cell lines have been widely used for breast cancer modelling which encompasses a panel of diseases with distinct phenotypical associations. Though cell lines provide unlimited homogenous materials for tumor studies and are relatively easy to culture, they are known to accumulate mutations duringthe initial establishment and subsequent series of cultivations. Thus, whether breast cancer cell line heterogeneity reflects that of carcinoma remains an important issue to resolve before drawing any reliable conclusion at the tumor level using cell lines. Inconsistent nomenclatures used for breast cancer cell line subtyping and the different number of subtypes grouped for cell lines and tumors make their direct matching elusive. By analyzing the molecular features of 92 breast cancer cell lines as documented by different literatures, we categorize 84 cell lines into 5 groups to be consistent with breast tumor classification. After combing through these cell lines, we summarized the molecular features, genetically and epigenetically, of each subtype, and manually documented 10 cell lines lacking explicit information on subtyping. Nine cell lines, either found inconsistent on their primary molecular features from different studies or being contaminated at the origin, are not suggested as the first choice for experimental use. We conclude that breast tumor cell lines, though having a high mutational frequency with many uncertainties and could not fully capture breast cancer heterogeneity, are feasible but crude models for tumors of the same subtype. New cell lines with enriched interferon regulated genes need to be established to enlarge the coverage of cell lines on tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Purpose.               Triple-negative breast cancer refers to breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). This study aimed to identify the key pathways and genes and find the potential initiation and progression mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).               Methods.               We downloaded the gene expression profiles of GSE76275 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. This microarray Super-Series sets are composed of gene expression data from 265 samples which included 67 non-TNBC and 198 TNBC. Next, all the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with p{$<$}0.01 and fold change ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5 were identified.               Result.               56 upregulated and 151 downregulated genes were listed and the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed. These significantly changed genes were mainly involved in the biological process termed prostate gland morphogenesis, inner ear morphogenesis, cell maturation, digestive tract morphogenesis, autonomic nervous system development, monovalent inorganic anion homeostasis, neural crest cell development, regulation of dendrite extension and glial cell proliferation, immune system process termed T cell differentiation, regulation of immune response, and macrophage activation. Genes are mainly involved in the KEGG pathway termed Oocyte meiosis. All DEGs underwent survival analysis using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) integrated by cBioPortal, of which amplification of SRY-related HMG-box 8 (SOX8), androgen receptor (AR), and Chromosome 9 Open Reading Frame 152 (C9orf152) were significantly negative while Nik Related Kinase (NRK) and RAS oncogene family 30 (RAB30) were positively correlated to the life expectancy (p{$<$}0.05).               Conclusions.               In conclusion, these pathways and genes identified could help understanding the mechanism of development of TNBC. Besides, SOX8, AR, C9orf152, NRK and RAB30, and other key genes and pathways might be promising targets for the TNBC treatment.},

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are defined as tumors that are negative for estrogen, progesterone and HER-2 receptor. At a percentage of 10-20\% TNBCs represent a minority in all breast cancers. However, because of the poor prognosis this particular subtype, triple negative disease accounts for a disproportionate number of metastatic cases and breast cancer deaths. Identification of its subtypes is essential for understanding the biological characteristics and clinical behavior of TNBC, as well as for developing personalized treatments. This review will focus on the great progress that has been made in the past few years on identifying new targets in TNBC subtypes and a variety of new treatment options that are on the verge of routine clinical application.},

  abstract = {Non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCL/P) is a complex, frequent congenital malformation, determined by the interplay between genetic and environmental factors during embryonic development. Previous findings have appointed an aetiological overlap between NSCL/P and cancer, and alterations in similar biological pathways may underpin both conditions. Here, using a combination of transcriptomic profiling and functional approaches, we report that NSCL/P dental pulp stem cells exhibit dysregulation of a co-expressed gene network mainly associated with DNA double-strand break repair and cell cycle control (p = 2.88×10−2–5.02×10−9). This network included important genes for these cellular processes, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and MSH2, which are predicted to be regulated by transcription factor E2F1. Functional assays support these findings, revealing that NSCL/P cells accumulate DNA double-strand breaks upon exposure to H2O2. Furthermore, we show that E2f1, Brca1 and Rad51 are co-expressed in the developing embryonic orofacial primordia, and may act as a molecular hub playing a role in lip and palate morphogenesis. In conclusion, we show for the first time that cellular defences against DNA damage may take part in determining the susceptibility to NSCL/P. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis of aetiological overlap between this malformation and cancer, and suggest a new pathogenic mechanism for the disease.},
